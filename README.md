# react-blog
---

A simple blog template powered by [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react)

## Instalation
`npm install --save`

## Run
There are several ways that work:
1. Put the directory to the DocumentRoot of an Apache Webserver
2. Run using npm script:

   `npm run start`

   Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## Misc:
1. This template is motivated by a blog template from  [Startboostrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/).
2. I have never been a (good) front-end developer.
My experience about HTML/CSS is very limited.
However, the release of ReactJS has motivated me to learn the framework
and this repository is just a simple blog template, which helps me achieve some basic knowledge about React.
React is just awsome :)
